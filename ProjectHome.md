Exactly what the title is, for a high school freshman project.  Through this, I will be learning about many different frameworks, and creating my first "worthy" Ruby project.


The following topics are nearly (if not completely) new to me:

--The tk GUI framework

--Complex Numbers in Code

--Fractals and Fractal Generation

--Object Orientated Programming (note: I have done a little bit in this, but nothing that deserves the tag of "object orientated code"
